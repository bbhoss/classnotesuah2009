Chapter 1:

    Statistics - collecting analyzing presenting and interpreting
    data.

    Data - Facts and figured collected and analyzed

    Data Set - Data colected for a particular study

    Quantitative Data - How much or how many {
          Interval: Difference between two numbers/datum {Ex: SAT
          Scores, Weather Temperatures}, Ratio: Comparing a statistic
          to another by terms of magitudes more or less, etc.{Ex: Twice as far, as
          long, etc}

    Qualitative Data -  Name or label {
          Nominal: Name, 
          Ordinal: Name, but rank is included and important.}

    Cross Sectional: Data collected at the same point in time. {Ex:
    Looking at several stock prices at one point}

    Time Series: Data looked at over a period of time. {Ex: Health
    studies, GOOG's price over YTD etc}

    Population vs. Sample: Population is everyone being studied, where
    sample is a certain group or subset of the population.  The bigger
    the sample, the more accurate your predictions will be.

    Examples of Data:{

    pg.20-21 #10
          a. Age: Quantitative (Ratio)
          b. Gender: Qualitative (Nominal)
          c. When did you start reading WSJ: Qualitative (Ordinal)
          d. Employment time: Quantitative (Ratio)
          e. What type of vehicle would you consider purchasing next:
    Qualitative (Nominal)

    #11
          a. Annual Sales: Quantitative (Ratio)
          b. Soft drink size: Qualitative (Ordinal)
          c. Employee Classification: Qualitative (Nominal)
          d. Earnings per share: Quantitative (Ratio)
          e. Method of payment: Qualitative (Nominal)

    }

Chapter 2:

   Frequencies:

        Frequency Distribution: Tabular summary of data.

        Relative Frequency: Relative frequency of a class. {Ex: TV
        Shows: }
        {Formula: Frequency of a Class / Number of classes}

        Qualitative Data:
              Bar Graph: 
                  Ex: #5 of pg 32
                  "Bars do not touch"
                  Horizontal axis: Labels for a class
                  Vertical axis: Frequency of occurence
                  Tips:
                      Be consistent with axis labeling (2,4,6,8,etc
                  instead of 2,6,9,18)  Also make sure labels make sense.

	Quantitative Data:
	       3 Steps to define class
	       	 1. Determine # of nonoverlapping classes
		 2. Determine width of the class
		 3. Determine the class limits

		    Class | Frequency | Relative Frequency | Cumulative Frequency | Cumulative Relative Frequency
		    12-14 | 2	      |	.05	 	   | 2			  | .05
		    15-17 | 8	      |	.20		   | 10 (2+8)		  | .25
		    18-20 | 11	      |	.275		   | 21 (10+11)		  | .525
		    21-23 | 10	      | .250		   | 31			  | .775
		    24-26 | 9	      | .225		   | 40			  | 1.000
		    Total | 40	      |	1.000		   

	      Histogram (Not Cumulative)
	      ==========
		- Can use relative frequency data (or frequency)
		- Place variable of interest on horizontal axis
		- Vertical - Frequency
		- All rectangles touch!
		
	     Ogive (Cumulative ONLY!)
	     ======
		- Cumulative values
		- Keep hash-marks consistent
